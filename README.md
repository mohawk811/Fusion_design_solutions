# Fusion_design_solutions
Hello everyone,
This repository is designed to help organize and share files and solutions among different groups. The files uploaded here should represent finalized or near-final versions (i.e., solutions that your group is satisfied with). The goal is to maintain a structured and up-to-date record of outputs, ensuring everyone stays aligned with the latest versions.

Best Practices:

Include the date in the filename for easier version tracking.

Clearly differentiate files based on their parameters or configurations.

Ensure that all files are well-documented for clarity across teams.
